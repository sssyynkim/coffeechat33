## Core criteria

### Core - First data persistence service

- **AWS service name:** S3
- **What data is being stored?:** image files
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** S3 is optimized for storing large media files like images and GIFs due to its ability to scale and handle large objects.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** DynamoDB is more suited for structured, low-latency data access, which is not optimal for large file storage.
- **Bucket name:** n11725605-assignment2
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
  - server/server.js
  - server/controllers/s3Controller.js
  - server/routes/postRoutes.js

### Core - Second data persistence service

- **AWS service name:** DynamoDB
- **What data is being stored?:** Metadata for posts (e.g., post titles, content, timestamps)
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** DynamoDB is ideal for fast and scalable data storage and retrieval, especially for structured data like post metadata.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** S3 is more suited for storing objects (files), and it does not handle structured metadata well.
- **table name:** n11725605-coffeechat2
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
  - server/server.js
  - server/controllers/dynamoController.js
  - server/routes/postRoutes.js

### Third data service

- **AWS service name:** EBS
- **What data is being stored?:**
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:**
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- ## **Relevant files:**

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

- **S3 Bucket names:** n11725605-assignment2
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
  - server/server.js
  - server/controllers/s3Controller.js

### In-memory cache

- **ElastiCache instance name:**
- **What data is being cached?:** [eg. Thumbnails from YouTube videos obatined from external API]
- **Why is this data likely to be accessed frequently?:** [ eg. Thumbnails from popular YouTube videos are likely to be shown to multiple users ]
- **Video timestamp:**
- ## **Relevant files:**

### Core - Statelessness #이건 수정해야할지도 !!

- **What data is stored within your application that is not stored in cloud data services?:** Intermediate image or GIF processing data before it is uploaded to S3.
- **Why is this data not considered persistent state?:** Intermediate data can be recreated or reprocessed, so its loss does not affect the application's state permanently.
- **How does your application ensure data consistency if the app suddenly stops?:** If the app crashes, image processing can be restarted without losing uploaded or final data in S3 or DynamoDB.
- **Relevant files:**
  - server/server.js
  - server/controllers/s3Controller.js

### Graceful handling of persistent connections

- **Type of persistent connection and use:** [eg. server-side-events for progress reporting]
- **Method for handling lost connections:** [eg. client responds to lost connection by reconnecting and indicating loss of connection to user until connection is re-established ]
- ## **Relevant files:**

### Core - Authentication with Cognito

- **User pool name:**
- **How are authentication tokens handled by the client?:** [eg. Response to login request sets a cookie containing the token.]
- **Video timestamp:**
- ## **Relevant files:**

### Cognito multi-factor authentication

- **Video timestamp:**
- ## **Relevant files:**
